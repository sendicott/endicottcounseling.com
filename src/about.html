            <hr class="light">
            <p>I believe strongly that parenthood is marvelous and complex but that it is also really hard. I also think  that it deserves far more care, attention, and support than most receive. As both a mother and a therapist, I am well versed in the opportunities for pain and struggle that parenthood brings. I have devoted myself to helping individuals and couples navigate these challenges, so that they may more fully experience the joy of this task.</p>
            <p>In working with clients, I take a compassionate, solution-oriented approach. I listen closely and kindly and cultivate a space of rest and reflection. I help people create solutions to complex problems and works with concerns such as infertility, perinatal loss, perinatal depression and anxiety, and birth trauma.</p>
            <p>Although I have active, problem-solving approach, listening within the context of my professional experience, I also attend to you as another human being and as a fellow mother who is on a similar journey. You are not alone and you will leave feeling that.</p>

            <h2>Prenatal Care</h2>
            <p>Pregnancy is a baffling season of transition. Even the smoothest pregnancies require constant adjustment and adaptation. In many cases, pregnancy is a time with complex and difficult feelings.</p> 
            <p>I provide support to women and couples negotiating these feelings as well as to those encountering prenatal anxiety and depression. I also work with those experiencing perinatal loss.</p>

            <h2>Postpartum Care</h2>
            <p>In recent years, research has been devoted to the significant challenge posed by the storm of life transitions, hormones, and emotions that we call postpartum. Every woman needs significant and multifaceted support during this time.</p>
            <p>I am passionate about providing postpartum women with attentive care. I work with women and couples experiencing postpartum anxiety, depression, difficulty transitioning into parenthood, and birth trauma.</p>

                <h2>Group Therapy</h2>
                <p>Wendell Berry puts it well when he says “healing is impossible in loneliness; it is the opposite of loneliness.” These groups are the opposite of loneliness. They are here to provide you with companionship and understanding from others who are at a similar stage. Each group is therapist-led, gentle, safe and substantive.</p> 
                <p>We are currently in the process of planning for summer prenatal and postpartum groups with a projected start in June. We keep our groups small (10 participants or less) and intimate. Groups cost $30/session and run for six weeks. Please email Zoe if you are unable to meet this cost but would like to join the group. As always, we do not let cost be prohibitive. If you want to be here, we will make a way. Groups meet in Charlotte, NC at 5105 Monroe Rd.</p>
